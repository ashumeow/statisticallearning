This is (or will hopefully be) a community-edited syllabus for statistical learning in political science (though it could be applied to most any social science). This syllabus is far from exhaustive and is intended to only cover materials relevant to social scientists intent on applying statistical learning methods to their data or to those wishing to solve problems in the social sciences by via methodological innovation in this area.
